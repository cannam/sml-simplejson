Simple Standard ML JSON parser
==============================

https://hg.sr.ht/~cannam/sml-simplejson

An RFC-compliant JSON parser in one SML file (json.sml) with no
dependency on anything outside the Basis library. Also includes a
simple serialiser.

Tested with MLton, Poly/ML, and SML/NJ compilers.

Parser notes:

 * Complies with RFC 7159, The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   Data Interchange Format

 * Passes all of the JSONTestSuite parser accept/reject tests that
   exist at the time of writing, as listed in "Parsing JSON is a
   Minefield" (http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php)
 
 * Two-pass parser using naive exploded strings, therefore not
   particularly fast and not suitable for large input files

 * Only supports UTF-8 input, not UTF-16 or UTF-32. Doesn't check
   that JSON strings are valid UTF-8 -- the caller must do that --
   but does handle \u escapes

 * Converts all numbers to type "real". If that is a 64-bit IEEE
   float type (common but not guaranteed in SML) then we're pretty
   standard for a JSON parser
